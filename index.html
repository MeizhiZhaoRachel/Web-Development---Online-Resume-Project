    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I have 4 years of experience as a quality guarantee professional in a Japanese enterprise, responsible for ensuring product 
            quality and maintaining production targets. With 5 years of customer service support, I have experience assisting customers 
            globally. </br> While working as a customer service specialist, I requested my IT department colleagues to update the 
            software functions, and that's when I discovered the cool and practical aspects of IT skills. I am pursuing a master's 
            degree in IT at the University of Canberra. </br> I enjoy reading, listening to classical music, and taking walks outdoors. 
            Once, I walked 16 kilometres along a river in an afternoon and had a wonderful experience. Thank you</p>
